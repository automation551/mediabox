Mediabox is a highly configurable, plugin-based architecture for building 
frontends to multimedia PCs running GNU/Linux or OS X. By itself, Mediabox is
essentially useless -- all of the functionality comes from loaded plugins and
'screens'.

Read the 'mediabox.conf.example' file for information on how to set up Mediabox.

Mediabox recognizes several types of plugins. The first, and most important, 
are 'screens' -- a screen is a largely self-contained program that does some
processing every tick, and displays some output to the screen. Only one screen
can be active at a time, but screens may yield execution to another screen of
their choice at any time. Depending on your application for Mediabox you will
load particular screens, or sets of screens. For example, the 'Slideshow' 
screen allows Mediabox to act like a digital picture frame, rotating through
images in a specified directory, the 'RecentTracks' screen displays a list of
recently played music from a user's Last.fm profile, and 'Clock' displays the
current time.

Secondly, Mediabox recognized both 'slotted' and 'unslotted' plugins. 'slotted'
plugins fill a particular role, and you may only have a single plugin loaded
per slot. For example, the graphics engine Mediabox uses to draw screens is 
implemented as a slotted plugin -- it would make little sense to load both SDL
and OpenGL engines. Conversely, multiple 'unslotted' plugins may be loaded; an
'unslotted' plugin extends Mediabox with additional features or functionality.
